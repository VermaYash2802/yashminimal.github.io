Hello! I am Yash Verma, college student at IIT Kharagpur majoring in Economics, passionate about startups and tech products.

Iâ€™m highly enthusiastic towards emerging technologies - particularly Blockchain and Climate Change. When not working, I read books, stream Netflix/Anime and/or travel. I believe in/try to practise Minimalism and Stoicism.

In the past I have worked for [Flobiz](https://flobiz.in/), [Greenlight Planet](https://www.greenlightplanet.com/), [Bobble.ai](https://www.bobble.ai/).
